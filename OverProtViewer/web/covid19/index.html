        <p>Our tool <strong>OverProt</strong> produces a secondary structure consensus for a given protein structural family. 
        Such consensus consists of several <em>consensus SSEs</em> (secondary structure elements). 
        Each consensus SSE represents a group of SSEs from the proteins in the family (0 or 1 SSE from each protein).<br> 
        More information is provided in 
        <a href='https://is.muni.cz/www/midlik/pv251_visualization/Elixir2019-Midlik.pdf' target='_blank'>this poster</a>
        presented at ELIXIR CZ Annual Conference 2019.</p>

        <p><strong>OverProtViewer</strong> allows interactive visualization of consensus produced by OverProt. 
        Each consensus SSE is shown as a rectangle – &beta;-strands from the same &beta;-sheet have the same color, while all helices are gray. 
        The height of the rectangle indicates the <em>occurrence</em> (what percentage of protein structures contain this SSE), 
        while the width indicates the <em>average length</em> (measured as the number of amino acid residues).
        Only consensus SSEs with occurrence above the <em>occurrence threshold</em> are shown (default: 20%). 
        Alternative visualization modes include different coloring methods, showing length distribution instead of the average length, 
        and visualization of beta-connectivity.</p>        

        <p>This page demonstrates OverProtViewer on several selected protein families.</p>
